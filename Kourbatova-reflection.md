*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I had a little bit of experience with Git and wasn't overtly confused about much. However, I'm still learning new things about Git all the time. The main thing I had some confusion about was just the workflow of several people making changes to the same repository, and it was good that we got to practice that in this GPS.


*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

The main thing I learned was that `git pull` is the same thing as `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. I also got some advice about when you would use `git pull` vs `git fetch` + `git merge` -- it basically depends on how big of a change you are making, and whether you're absolutely sure that `git pull` won't overwrite changes that you meant to keep.

We also got some guidance about using commit messages to communicate not only which changes were made, but also *why* they were made.


*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

We discussed what I mentioned in the previous question. I asked the guide about ways of applying the GitHub workflow to pairing sessions.


*What still confuses you about Git?*

Sometimes the information Git displays as it executes commands (for example pulling or merging) doesn't completely make sense to me. So it can feel like there is information hidden in plain sight that I'm not taking advantage of.

I often run into new information that I realize I don't understand yet, for example in [this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16490873/how-to-avoid-git-conflicts-in-a-team) of merge conflicts there were some answers that contained a lot of technical terms I'd never seen before. I will be going back to learn more.


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

This wasn't my first experience (I switched cohorts, so I've already done a couple GPS's). It went well! It was encouraging to hear that our approach to checking in with each other was good, and that what I do on the command line and with Git is on the right track.
