#Reflection:
###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? ..
Before, this session I was not aware of the git fetch and merge commands and their purposes.
###What concepts were clarified during the GPS? ..
The GPS clearly defined the purpose of doing a git fetch and merge.
###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? ..
I asked my pair how to add inline images in markdown files, and we asked the guide about fetch and merge.
###What still confuses you about Git? ..
As of now, all of my questions about Git have been answered.
###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? ..
I enjoyed my first experience with a GPS. It is very helpful to have a guide to answer any questions that come up. I felt that the amount involvement of the guide was just perfect. Meaning, My pair and I were allowed enough space to figure things out together while the GPS intervened when necessary.
